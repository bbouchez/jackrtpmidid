jackrtpmidid is a Linux daemon designed specifically for the Zynthian Open Source Synthesizer : https://zynthian.org/ but nothing prevents it to be used on any other Linux machine.

The daemon is used by the Zynthian to create the RTP-MIDI endpoint which can be activated via the Zynthian's Admin menu.

In order to compile the daemon, you will need files from these libraries :
